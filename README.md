# RL with Convolution-Augmented Attention and Gate Mechanism for Job Shop Scheduling
## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of our Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework, presented in our paper "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework with Convolution-Augmented Attention and Gate Mechanism for Job Shop Scheduling." Our framework leverages a novel combination of convolution-augmented attention and a gating mechanism to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), a complex combinatorial optimization problem.

## Features
Convolution-Augmented Attention: Enhances local pattern recognition within the JSSP environment.
Gate Mechanism: Facilitates effective integration of convolution and multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layers.
End-to-End Training: Utilizes a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm within an actor-critic framework for training.
Comprehensive Graph Representations: Captures both local and global dependencies for optimal scheduling.

## Proposed DRL Framework
The following figure depicts our advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning model, integrating a convolution-augmented attention mechanism for job shop scheduling. It details the architecture, highlighting how convolution layers and attention modules synergistically process scheduling data.
